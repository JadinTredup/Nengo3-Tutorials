# Nengo3-Tutorials

The tutorial notebooks for 'How to Build a Brain' (originally created for Nengo2 here: [Nengo2-Tutorials](https://github.com/s72sue/Nengo2-Tutorials)) with very slight modification for Nengo3.

## List of stylistic changes:
* Notebooks are being consolidated so that there is one notebook per chapter.
* Chapter names are taken from the "Nengo" portion at the end of each chapter, rather than the title of the whole book chapter. I feel this better represents the information presented in the tutorials.

## List of changes necessary for conversion to 3.0
